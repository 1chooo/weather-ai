### Abstract
Due to IOT resource constrained -> luring targets to address security amd privacy issues through traditional cryptographic approaches (insufficient)

resource constraints, heterogeneity, massive real-time data generated from IOT devices

goal:
- security requirements
- attack vectors
- current security solutions (existing ML, DL)
- future research directions

### Introduction

We have to detail more about the IOT in the brief!!!

IoT is considered as an interconnected and distributed network of embedded systems communicating through wired or wireless communication technologies [1]. It is also defined as the network of physical objects or things empowered with limited computation, storage, and communication capabilities as well as embedded with electronics (such as sensors and actuators), software, and network connectivity that enables these objects to collect, sometime process, and exchange data


Huge Scale

However, the cornerstone of the commercialization of IoT technology is the security and privacy guarantee as well as consumer satisfaction. The fact that IoT uses enabling technologies such as Software- Defined Networking (SDN), Cloud Computing (CC), and fog computing, also increases the landscape of threats for the attackers.

ML techniques have been used in tasks such as classification, regression and density estimation. Vari- ety of applications such as computer vision, fraud detection, bio-informatics, malware detection, authentication, and speech recognition use ML algorithms and techniques.

### A. Characteristics of IoT Networks
### B. Security Challenges in IoT Deployment
### C. Gaps in the Existing Security Solution for IoT Networks
### D. Machine Learning: A Solution to IoT Security Challenges
include artificial intelligence, optimization theory, information theory, and cognitive science, to name the few Machine learning is utilized when human expertise either do not exist or cannot be used such as navigating a hostile place where humans are unable to use their expertise, for instance robotics, speech recognition etc.
### E. Existing Surveys
### F. Scope of This Survey and Contributions

The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
1) We present an in-depth systematic and comprehensive survey of the role of machine and deep learning mech- anisms in IoT.
2) We describe state-of-the-art results on ML and DL in IoT network with a focus on security and privacy of the IoT networks.
3) We describe the limitations of the existing security solutions of the IoT networks that lead to using ML and DL techniques.
4) We also present an in-depth review of different research challenges related to the application of ML and DL techniques in IoT that need to be addressed.
